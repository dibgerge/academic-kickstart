This is a topic co project focuses on demonstration of ultrasound sensing technology and techniques for various applications related to nuclear power plant life cycle, next generation advanced reactors, and radiation monitoring at border portals. The focus of this research has been on:

- Assessment of  conventional ultrasound and non-linear ultrasound non-destructive evaluation techniques capable of detecting impending damage before crack formation. This project focuses on creep and fatigue damage modalities in nuclear power plants.
- Development of high temperature ultrasound sensor probes, capable of withstanding temperatures up to 550 C for extended period of time. Also, the sensors are designed to be capable of reliable damage detection in sodium coolants.
- Assessment of ultrasound inspection reliability under challenging environments, and sensor calibration and methods for compensating sensor aging.
- Water detection in spent fuel dry cask storage canisters.
- Fog detection in PVT scintillators used at border portals for radiation detection. Fog build up in those plastic detectors reduce their sensitivity. We assessed ultrasound techniques for predicting fogging levels in the detectors.
