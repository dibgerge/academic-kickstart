abstract = "Computer modeling and simulation is becoming an essential tool for transducer design and insight into ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation (UT-NDE). As the popularity of simulation tools for UT-NDE increases, it becomes important to assess their reliability to model acoustic responses from defects in operating components and provide information that is consistent with in-field inspection data. This includes information about the detectability of different defect types for a given UT probe. Recently, a cooperative program between the Electrical Power Research Institute and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission was established to validate numerical modeling software commonly used for simulating UT-NDE of nuclear power plant components. In the first phase of this cooperative, extensive experimental UT measurements were conducted on machined notches with varying depth, length, and orientation in stainless steel plates. Then, the notches were modeled in CIVA, a semi-analytical NDE simulation platform developed by the French Commissariat a lâ€™Energie Atomique, and their responses compared with the experimental measurements. Discrepancies between experimental and simulation results are due to either improper inputs to the simulation model, or to incorrect approximations and assumptions in the numerical models. To address the former, a variation study was conducted on the different parameters that are required as inputs for the model, specifically the specimen and transducer properties. Then, the ability of simulations to give accurate predictions regarding the detectability of the different defects was demonstrated. This includes the results in terms of the variations in defect amplitude indications, and the ratios between tip diffracted and specular signal amplitudes."
