Hi, my name is Gerges (جرجس), which is the arabic pronunciation of Georges, which is the french spelling of George, so everyone calls me George. I currently work as an applied scientist at Amazon, where I have been building and deploying machine learning and forecasting models for AWS workforce planning, and more recently for data center operations. Before joining Amazon, I was at Pacific Northwest National laboratory, doing all things related to Ultrasonics including measurement techniques, modeling and simulation, signal and image processing, machine learning applications for electroencephalograms (EEG). The intersection of computer science, mathematics, and physics is my happy place. When I'm not working, I am trying to get better at them, or out hiking.
