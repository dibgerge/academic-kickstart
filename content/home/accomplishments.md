  I was selected to participate in an intensive 2-day practical deep learning bootcamp organized by deeplearning.ai. We worked in a team of 4 on selecting, training, testing, and demonstrating an object detection detection model. The bootcamp went through all the steps required to build a successful model, starting for understanding client requirements to deploying the model on an android phone.

  In addition to completing the class, I fully re-wrote the class assignments (starter code + instructions) in python Jupyter notebooks, which allows interested students to submit the assignments using python instead of the native Matlab assignments <i>(this does not apply to students taking class in exchange for a certificate)</i>.
